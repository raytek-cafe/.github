# Raytek Cafe

Tired of the same new AI-infested, corporate-controlled, soulless tech that makes up today's world? We feel you.

raytek is a group of friends who, being unhappy with the current state of the tech world, attempt to change the landscape into what it used to be - computers that work for the user, not the other way around.

This website is a collection of our work and knowledge, ranging from simple scripts and tweaks to entire software backports and DIY projects. Additionally, we have a blog where we share our thoughts on different topics related to hardware, software, gaming and more.

Since reviving old tech is one of our main goals, this site is compatible with older browsers and systems, the baseline being New Moon on Windows XP. In the future, we plan to add a compatibility stylesheet for IE8 and RetroZilla, so that even your toaster can open this website.

As you may have noticed, the design of this website is very reminiscent of old skeuomorphic interfaces - using smooth shadows, glow effects and gradients, we wanted to bring back that sense of depth and realism that many modern designs have abandoned in favor of a more minimalistic approach. We believe that this design choice enhances the user experience, making it more engaging and visually appealing.

We hope our projects prove useful and inspiring for the tech community. We welcome contributions and suggestions, so if you have any ideas or feedback, feel free to reach out to us via GitHub.
